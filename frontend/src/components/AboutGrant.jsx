                About UPCST Grant Scheme
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                The <strong className="text-gray-800">UPCST Grant Scheme</strong> is a visionary initiative by the Uttar Pradesh Council of Science and Technology, aimed at
                <strong> fostering research and development in science, technology, and innovation</strong>. This scheme provides financial support
                to individuals and institutions working on research projects with tangible, real-world applications that can contribute to
                societal development and economic growth.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                It is specifically designed to empower students, early-career researchers, academic faculty, and innovators by enabling them to
                transform their ideas into functional prototypes, products, or scientific models. The scheme emphasizes a problem-solving
                approach to address key challenges in domains such as <strong>energy, environment, healthcare, education, rural technology, agriculture,</strong> and
                <strong> public welfare</strong>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Under this scheme, the funding typically covers:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 pl-4">
                <li>Procurement of scientific equipment and tools</li>
                <li>Development and testing expenses</li>
                <li>Research materials and consumables</li>
                <li>Contingency and operational costs</li>
                <li>Fieldwork, data collection, and analysis</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                A key strength of the grant is its encouragement of <strong>interdisciplinary collaboration</strong> â€” promoting partnerships across diverse
                fields of science and engineering to spark innovation. By supporting early-stage ideas, it acts as a <strong>launchpad for experimental
                concepts</strong> that might otherwise struggle to secure funding.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Over the years, the UPCST Grant Scheme has enabled the successful execution of numerous high-impact projects. These have
                contributed directly to <strong>sustainable energy practices, environmental conservation, advanced healthcare solutions, and rural empowerment</strong>.
                Through this initiative, UPCST continues to build a robust innovation ecosystem, nurturing the next generation of scientists,
                engineers, and technologists.
